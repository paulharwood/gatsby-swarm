On March 18th 2020, SWARM was convened, led by Swansea’s TechHub as a volunteer response to support the South West Wales Health Board’s (Hywel Dda and Swansea Bay) need for knowledge and information on supplies to support its Covid-19 response. 

SWARM was a response to specific NHS supply chain challenges that accompany this unique situation.

As Category 1 responders under the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 our health boards respond to large-scale emergencies with wide ranging, far reaching and agile strategies. SWARM were asked to form to support those strategies, by Business Wales.
