# Example Listing
## Overview
A team set up to show you how a support team should be structured. Please try to keep a consistent format for the page as we may need to extract the data into another system later.


### Goals
The goals of this team are to:
- Provide a link to industry suppliers
- Explore industry options for this group
- Prepare a supply chain for a specific need

## Current issues
- Requesting something from an [example external supplier](https://external-supplier-example-link)
- Urgent ask for an [example resource](/example-resource) (e.g. masks)

### Team communication channels

- e-mail
- whatsapp (primary) [Join here](https://whatsaopp.join-link.examplelink)
- Microsoft teams [Join here](https://join-link.examplelink)

(a team can have many ways of communicating, but all members must be able to access the primary method)
