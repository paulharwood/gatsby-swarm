  description: >
    A community factory resource of rapid prototypers, entrepreneurs, experts,
    manufacturing companies, academic professionals, manufacturing and design
    engineers in and around South Wales.
description: The South Wales Additive and Rapid Manufacturing directory was
  initially set up as a consortium to help the NHS source and supply items it
  needed to address the COVID19 coronavirus pandemic. SWARM proved that you
  could quickly mobilise a community factory and react to a crisis. We decided
  the value of the network established could potentially grow and be useful to
  other organisations. This resource is open to everyone, not owned and
  controlled by anyone, and can be used by whoever see's value in it.
